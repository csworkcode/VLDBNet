## MEBI-2000 dataset

MEBI-2000 dataset is derived from the public dataset of Ali Tianchi competition. It consists of 2000 scanned images and photos taken with mobile phones, specifically created for detecting and recognizing medical ticket text. The dataset covers various invoice types, including discharge summaries, prescription invoices, outpatient invoices, and inpatient invoices. It represents real-life scenarios encountered in medical insurance applications and encompasses challenges such as mixed text and images, camera shake, skewed images, densely populated text, and table data. Sensitive information in the images has been anonymized to ensure privacy protection. MEBI-2000 provides a practical and representative dataset for medical insurance image analysis.
